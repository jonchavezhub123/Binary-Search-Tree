# Binary-Search-Tree
The `Insert()` function inserts a node with the data value `x` in the tree.  - For the `Search()` function, `x` is the data value of a leaf to be searched for. If the search is successful, the `Search()` function returns **true**; otherwise, it returns **false**.  - The `Remove()` function first calls the `Search()` function to determine the result of the search for a leaf with the data value `x`, and if the search is successful, then it calls `_Remove()`; the private version of the `Remove()` function to remove the corresponding leaf from the tree and returns **true**; otherwise, it returns **false**.  - The `_Leaf()` function simply checks if a node is a leaf.  The private versions of the member functions `_Insert()`, `_Remove()`, and `_Search()` can be implemented as recursive functions, but these functions have an additional argument, which is the root of the tree. The private version of the `_Remove()` function unlike its public version does not return any value.
